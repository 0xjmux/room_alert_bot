# room_alert_bot
Discord bot to alert people in the IEEE UCI Discord when the room is open

### Usage
Flip switch "On" to send a discord message alerting people the room is open. Flip switch "Off" to send a message alerting people that the room is closed. 


### Indicator Light Behavior
* When operating correctly, only one light should be on at a time. The lights will ONLY change once a message has successfully been posted to discord.
* On errors, they blink. There should be a single blink on startup to indicate that the program is running.
